## An exercise in reading machine code

Every year we get one or two problems that aren't so much about designing a solution to a problem, but which depend on
reading the puzzle input and working the solution from there instead of doing it from the problem statement. This is
not worth my time, and since my approach to these annoying problems each year is to just migrate code from one
language into Clojure, I decided the source I would plagarize is my good friend Todd Ginsberg. So if you want to read
his approach, please go to [his write-up](https://todd.ginsberg.com/post/advent-of-code/2021/day24/). My code is
instruction-by-instruction his solution.
